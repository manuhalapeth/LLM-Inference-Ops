# Specification

The hardware, software, time and money behind each phase, with the key numbers it produced. Measured numbers come from the files in `results/`; hardware and billing details come from the Vast.ai console.

## Phase 0: Foundations

### Hardware

| | |
|---|---|
| Provider | Vast.ai, Secure Cloud (verified data center), on demand |
| Location | Hungary (data center 81036, machine 30024) |
| Host reliability | 99.60% |
| GPU | 1× NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 |
| GPU memory | 32 GB GDDR7 (31.8 GB usable) |
| GPU memory bandwidth | 1,455 GB/s |
| GPU compute | 108.1 TFLOPS (as reported by Vast.ai) |
| GPU driver / max CUDA | 580.95.05 / 13.3 |
| GPU link | PCIe 5.0 ×16 (54.2 GB/s) |
| CPU | AMD EPYC 9654 (96 cores), 48 of 384 vCPUs allocated |
| System RAM | 96.7 GB |
| Disk | 130 GB NVMe (KIOXIA), ~19 GB/s |
| Network | ~6.4 Gbps down / ~5.3 Gbps up |
| Machine image | Vast.ai Ubuntu 22.04 VM template (`vastai/kvm:cuda-12.9.1-auto`) |

### Software

| | |
|---|---|
| Model | Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (BF16) |
| Inference engine | vLLM 0.30.0 (`vllm/vllm-openai`, digest `sha256:8a69ffad015f…`) |
| Engine config | `vllm/configs/baseline.yaml`: GPU memory utilization 0.90, max context 8,192 tokens |
| Stack | FastAPI gateway → NGINX 1.27 → vLLM, Prometheus 2.55.1, Grafana 11.3.0 |
| Code version | git `acce6ba` |

### Time and money

| | |
|---|---|
| GPU price | $1.327/hr (storage only while booting: $0.061/hr) |
| VM boot time | ~8 min (rent → running) |
| Setup script to "Ready" | ~5 min (includes the model download and vLLM warm up) |
| Total instance lifetime | ~24 min (rent → destroy) |
| Credit used | ~$0.40 ($25.00 → $24.61 at 23 min) |

### vLLM startup

From `results/00_setup/vllm_startup.log`.

| | |
|---|---|
| Model weights on disk | 14.19 GiB |
| Weights download time | 35 s (~410 MB/s) |
| Model load time | 43 s |
| Weights in GPU memory | 14.29 GiB |
| CUDA graph capture | 63 s + 59 s |
| Memory left for KV cache | 11.19 GiB |
| KV cache capacity | 209,472 tokens |
| Max concurrent requests at 8,192 tokens each | 25.6 |

### Results: one streaming request (smoke test)

From `results/00_setup/20261003T034035Z_smoke_test.json`. One request, no other load: gateway → NGINX → vLLM.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Time to first token (TTFT) | 281 ms |
| End to end latency | 878 ms |
| Inter token latency | 9.6 ms (~104 tokens/s while decoding) |
| Tokens | 44 in / 63 out |
| Overall throughput | 71.7 output tokens/s |

### Phase 0 takeaway

On an RTX 5090, the 7B model takes 14.3 GiB, leaving 11.2 GiB (~209k tokens) of KV cache. A single request decodes at ~104 tokens/s. KV cache capacity is the first limit later phases will hit.
